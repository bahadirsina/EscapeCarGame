# EscapeCarGame
ESCAPE CAR. Don't hit the oncoming vehicles and increase your score.

Design and Technology

We will use pygame, random, sys libraries in our project. Pygame is already a python game library.
Thanks to this library, we will prepare our game in general. Sys library will be used to stop the application.
Random library, we are considering randomly assigning the speeds of oncoming vehicles so that some are
fast and some are slow.


Future Works

1- First, the player will be asked to press any key on the keyboard to start the game.

2- Then the score will start to progress. As long as the player does not hit the oncoming vehicles, the
score will progress and the vehicles will continue to come randomly from the opposite direction.

3- When the player hits the oncoming vehicle, the game will end and the screen will welcome us. The
screen will show the score made, as well as the try again button.

4- The score will be kept at the highest score recorded. Players will try to get the highest score.

5- Scores will be recorded and the highest score will be on our screen. In short, the aim of the game is
for the players to try to get the highest score.

Added in addition

• First of these, we will add music, exciting music will be played as you progress through the game
without crashing into cars, but disappointing music will be played when the player crashes into the
car.

• Secondly, cars will slow down when a key is pressed. When the player starts to have difficulties, the
speed of the cars will decrease and the player will be comfortable thanks to this feature.

• Thirdly, we are considering adding features such as cars going backwards when a key is pressed. The
player will be able to get rid of the cars thanks to this feature, just before he hits the cars.
